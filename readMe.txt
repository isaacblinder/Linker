For this project I created a two-pass linker.

Compiling the code: (Mac)
The program accepts one argument, the text doc (the input).
For simplicity, make sure the text doc is in the same folder as the project.

1) Navigate to the project folder using cd
2) Compile using    javac Linker.java
3) run using    java Linker nameOfTextdoc.txt

The output should be printed to the terminal.
